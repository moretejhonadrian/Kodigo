    Operating System Concepts covers the functions of operating systems, computer-system architecture, structure, operations, and storage management. An Operating System is a program that serves as an intermediary between a computer user and its hardware, with the primary goals of executing user programs, making problem-solving easier, making the computer system more convenient, and efficiently using the computer hardware. The computer system consists of four components hardware, which provides basic computing resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices the operating system, which controls and coordinates hardware use among applications and users application programs, which define how system resources are used to solve user computing problems and users, including people, machines, and other computers. The Operating System (OS) is a resource allocator that manages all resources, decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair use, and controls program execution to prevent errors and improve computer usage. The computer startup process initializes all system aspects, loads the operating system kernel, and starts execution by loading the bootstrap program, typically stored in ROM or EPROM, during power-up or reboot. Computer system organization involves CPUs and device controllers connecting through a common bus, allowing shared memory access, and concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles. Computer-system operation involves concurrent execution of I/O devices and CPU, with each device controller handling a specific device type and local buffer. The CPU moves data from main memory to local buffers, and I/O is from the device to the controller's buffer. Computer storage is based on the basic unit of bits, which can contain one of two values 0 and 1. Computer storage and most computer throughput are generally measured and manipulated in bytes and collections of bytes. The storage hierarchy organizes storage systems based on speed, cost, and volume. Caching is a crucial principle in computer systems, transferring information from slower to faster storage temporarily. Traditional computing environments include stand-alone machines, portals for web access, network computers, and mobile computers that connect via wireless networks. Network Operating Systems provide features between systems across the network, allowing them to exchange messages. Client-Server computing has evolved from dumb terminals to smart PCs, with many systems now serving clients. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing environments are distributed systems where all nodes are considered peers, acting as either clients or servers. Virtualization is a growing industry that allows operating systems to run applications within other operating systems.
