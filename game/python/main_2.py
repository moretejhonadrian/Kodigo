notes = "Operating System Concepts covers the functions of operating systems, computer-system architecture, structure, operations, and storage management. An Operating System is a program that serves as an intermediary between a computer user and its hardware, with the primary goals of executing user programs, making problem-solving easier, making the computer system more convenient, and efficiently using the computer hardware. The computer system consists of four components: hardware, which provides basic computing resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices; the operating system, which controls and coordinates hardware use among applications and users; application programs, which define how system resources are used to solve user computing problems; and users, including people, machines, and other computers. The Operating System (OS) is a resource allocator that manages all resources, decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair use, and controls program execution to prevent errors and improve computer usage."
